# Overview

Electron is a very popular open source library developed by GitHub to create cross-platform desktop applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here we provide steps through which you can kick start your Electron application using `react-boilerplate`. As you have come here to build a desktop application, I assume that you are a little bit familiar with Electron. Electron provides a combined single runtime of Chromium and Node.js where you don't require a server anymore to host your React application. We can simply package the entire source code in an exe, dmg or deb file.

#### If you are just starting your Electron application with this boilerplate from scratch or you don't have time to read all the steps, you can clone the following fork of react-boilerplate:
