# Overview

Electron is a very popular open source library developed by GitHub to create cross-platform desktop application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This article explains some steps through which you can kick start your Electron application using this boilerplate. As you have come here to build a desktop application, I assume that you are a little bit familiar with Electron. Electron provides a combined single runtime of Chromium and Node.js where you don't require a server anymore to host your React application. We can simply package the entire source code in an exe, dmg or deb file.

#### If you are just starting your Electron application with this boilerplate from scratch or you are too lazy to read all the steps, you can clone the following repository that has been created by forking this boilerplate:
